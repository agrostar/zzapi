      # Purpose:
      To get a list of attributes that the user can set to personalize/customize
      the crop schedule.

      # Description:
      There are a set of possible 9 attributes totally for a schedule. The applicable
      attributes are different for each crop. For the crop, if all schedules have * as the 
      only possible value, then that attribute will be excluded in the returned list.

      Currently, the plan is to support only choice types

      # Notes:
      * defaultChoice may not be present in the response. If that's the case, the user will
        be forced to answer the question.
      * The auth token will be checked for a valid user, but the response is not personalized.
