TODO

Immediate:

* Handle variables:
  * envs and varsets, load from zz-envs.yaml
  * Use status bar and dropdown to pick from one of the envs
  * Use envs to replace $variable and $(variables)

* For MVP:
  * Tests (to be detailed)

Think about:
* Support foo: bar kind of headers and params in addition to arrays
* use parseDocument to parse the yaml (compare timings with regex), so that we don't have to 
*
